<div class="width-helper"><p><span class="bold">Disclaimer:</span> Built as a collaboration between community agencies, funders and researchers from the

University of British Columbia and Okanagan College, i-Search Kelowna aims to reduce the time

experienced when investigating housing options in the area. i-Search Kelowna does not place individuals

in housing and appearance on this site should not be considered an endorsement of service. Agencies

have provided information on how they accept and place individuals and the services they offer.

However, they update information, so it is recommended that you contact individual agencies for

specific program information.</p></div></section>
