Any agency or organization who provides housing that fits under the Housing Definitions <a href="https://isearchkelowna.ca/definitions">(click here for link to housing definitions)</a> listed on this site (emergency, transitional, supportive, low income or market rental) who are NOT currently represented on this map, may request to create a login.
A login is required in order to add your housing resource to the mapping tool or to add or delete information for a particular housing location. One login will be created for each agency, and for each individual property.

In order to update the information for your agency or housing property, ensure that you are logging in with the associated Login ID for that agency or property.
Once you are logged in, you can locate your property or agency through the map by navigating to your location, or you can type in the name of the property or agency in the search bar. Only the individual logged in with the appropriate ID can edit what is displayed on the screen for that particular property or agency. 
Once you have made the appropriate edits, there is a “save” button located at the top and bottom of the form.
