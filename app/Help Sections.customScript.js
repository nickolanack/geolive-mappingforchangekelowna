If this is your first time using i-Search Kelowna, the video link below walks you simply and quickly through the steps to create your first search.
<br/><br/>
Step 1: Determine the kind of housing that you are looking for. You can refer to our housing definitions to help you decide the category of housing that best meets your needs. If you are looking for housing that would be considered “market rental” in Kelowna, you may wish to check out rental agencies or www.castanet.net for more options.<br/><br/>
Step 2: Narrow down who the housing is for:<br/><br/>
•	Is the housing for an individual only, or are you looking to house a couple or family?<br/>
•	Is the housing for a specific gender (male/female/transgender)? This is most relevant if you are looking for housing that caters to a specific gender only - such as a women’s shelter. <br/>
•	Is the housing that you need for a specific age group (child (under 15), youth (15-25), seniors)?<br/><br/>
Step 3: Submit. When you have finished selecting your options, hit the submit button. You will be redirected to the map site where the results most related to your choices will be displayed.

<h1>Advanced Search</h1>
<div class="width-helper"><p>
While your initial search may provide you with housing options that align with your criteria, you may be interested in creating a more detailed search incorporating additional filters.
Step 1: Click on the advance search icon - the red button on the top left of the map.<br/><br/>

Step 2: Click on the icons that match the criteria you are searching for (if you hover over the icons with your mouse you will have a short description). Your search will determine which markers then appear on the map.<br/><br/>

Step 3: Using the buttons "Items that match all fields" and  "Items that match any field" you can set your filters to include ALL of the search items or JUST the search items that are contained in the markers.
