    "Service Details": "- Works with Ethiopian communities, focusing the areas of greatest need: infrastructure improvement, health and welfare and women&#39;s anti-poverty projects- Projects are proposed Ethiopian community or partner, which has to contribute at least 15-20% of project costs (usually in the form of labour) and participates as a true partner in all decisions relating to the project- Once a project has been selected and a partnership agreement entered into, then Partners in the Horn of Africa and its African counterpart share in the responsibility for getting the project &#39;up and running&#39;- This model gives the local community a sense of ownership, and ensures that the project is responsive to local needs- 100% of donations to Partners goes directly to project costs in Ethiopia- The Canadian directors of Partners and others volunteer their time in running the organization and fundraising, and along with some private benefactors, pay for all administrative and travel expenses",
